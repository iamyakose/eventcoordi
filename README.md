### Problem Definition

The small start-up IT company EventCoordi ( http://eventcoordi.com ) has found a market niche in providing software
support for organization and management of events as a service for companies, social groups and private
customers.


Their product Event Organiser is planned as a large integrated platform, which makes event organization a
simple job for non-technical users, by automating a big part of the related processes.
The range of implementations includes, but is not limited to, organisation of cultural and sport events,
conferences and exhibitions, meetings and lectures, business parties and team building arrangements,
where management of participants, schedules, accommodation, transportation, facilities, or catering is
needed.


eventcoordi outsources the development of Event Organiser to your team.
### Task
Your task is to design, develop and implement a software system, which provides business services and
automates business processes, related to organization of events, by means of integration and
interoperability of disparate components.
Your team is free to decide on the implementation scenarios, development environments and integration
platforms.
You are strongly advised to reuse the product, created in Development of Large Systems, as well as
appropriate services and/or subsystems from completed System Integration assignments.
Requirements
To fulfil the objective, the project solution must respond to certain requirements, specified below:
Product
The product is an integrated system of various components/subsystems that
* enables management and automation of at least two business processes
* connects several disparate subsystems and data sources, where
* at least one is a legacy system and one is a new application
* at least one is a monolith system and one is built of microservices
* at least one of the components is a web service from either local or public resource
